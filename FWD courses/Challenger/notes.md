##HTML Elements Review 1
Here are the HTML elements that you've seen so far in this course. If you haven't tried them out yet in your own text editor and browser, this is a great time to do it!

- `<em>` and ` <strong> ` — Emphasis.
- By default, text inside `<em>` is displayed as italic, and text in <strong> is displayed as boldface.
- ` <p>` — Paragraph.
- Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.
- `<br>` — Line break. (empty)
- A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
- `<sub>` and <sup> — Subscript and superscript.
- Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.
- `<mark>` — Highlighting.
- Not very often used, but it's kind of cool.
- Of these elements, the `br` element is the only one that is an empty (or void) element.

##The div element
In the video on block and inline elements, you may (or may not) have noticed that one of the block-level elements Kelly mentioned was called ```div```.
